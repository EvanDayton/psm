                Because of this, we've learned over the years what works (and what doesn't!).

            To execute projects smoothly, we normally implement a series of tools and processes such as a shared project
            management board (Asana or the tool of your choice), Gantt charts, and project status reports as well as a shared
            Slack channel including both teams. Additionally, we establish weekly status meetings to oversee project progress,
            and for longer engagements, we add bi-weekly or monthly strategic syncs to make sure we are nailing strategy,
            positioning, and general direction.
